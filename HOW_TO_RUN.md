## 📊 API Endpoints (Backend)

These are what your frontend calls:

```bash
# Backend API (localhost:8000)
GET  /jobs                 # Browse/search jobs
POST /chat                 # AI chat
GET  /stats                # System info
POST /user/profile         # Save preferences
GET  /user/profile/{id}    # Get preferences
```

**You don't need to call these directly** - the frontend does it for you!

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Frontend shows blank page

**Solution:**

```bash
# Check console for errors
# Make sure backend is running
curl http://localhost:8000/stats
```

### "Network Error" in frontend

**Solution:**

```bash
# Backend not running - start it:
cd ai-job-screener
source venv/bin/activate
./run_backend.sh
```

### No jobs showing

**Solution:**

```bash
# Rebuild index with current jobs:
cd ai-job-screener
./rebuild_index.sh
```

### Search returns nothing

**Reason:** You only have 5 jobs currently
**Solution:** That's normal! Scrape more jobs later
